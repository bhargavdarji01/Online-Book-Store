# Online-Book-Store

</p>Online Book Store was a project based on PHP,MySql, Javascript, Ajax. 
It focused primarily on functionality rather than UI. 
We made this project in such a way that User can see the list of books, can add books in the shopping cart, can view the cart any time, can remove from the cart, and places the order and details are captured in Database.
Payment Gateway was not integrated as was not a part of Project.</p>
